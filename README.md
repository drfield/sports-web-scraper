# sports-web-scraper
This is a repository for roster, stat and live score web scrapers.

This project was started on python in Jupyter Notebooks. I've included exported python files for each of the initial functioning scrapers.

The sites using Sidearm have specific tags that don't change from site to site for their roster pages.

The WMT powered sites do not have specific tags for their rosters and the order of information can change from site to site. Example: One school could have player position as their third column while another school could have player weight as the third column.
